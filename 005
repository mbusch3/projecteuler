/*
Problem #5 from ProjectEuler.net

2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.

What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?

The solution below allowed me to claim the 292,637th correct answer. Yay!

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main(){
    
    /* Imagine doing this problem with the numbers 1 - 4. The LCM of 1, 2, and 
    3 is simply 1 * 2 * 3, or 6. But then we get into the business of common
    factors making simple multiplication unfeasible. A simple and elegant work-
    around is to take the current LCM (6) and just add it to itself until we
    find a number that also has 4 as a factor. This guarantees we'll get 12 and
    not overdo it and get 24. */
    
    int factors = 20;
    int i = 1;
    int LCM = 1;
    int temp;
    
    while(i <= factors){
        temp = LCM;   // Since we'll be adding to LCM, store it to prevent excessive doubling.
        while(LCM % i != 0){
            LCM += temp;
        }   
        i++;
    }
    
    cout << "Lowest common multiple is: " << LCM << endl;
    
    return 0;
