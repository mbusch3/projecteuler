/*
Problem #6 from ProjectEuler.net

The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

12 + 22 + ... + 102 = 385
The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

(1 + 2 + ... + 10)2 = 552 = 3025
Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural
numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred
natural numbers and the square of the sum.

The solution below allowed me to claim the 294,410th correct answer. Yay!

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main(){
    
    /* This seems fairly straightforward, so I figured I'd compute both at
    once in the same loop.
    */
    
    int i = 1;
    int limit = 100;
    int sumfirst = 0;
    int squarefirst = 0;
    
    while(i <= limit){
        sumfirst += i;
        squarefirst += i * i;
        i++;
    }
    sumfirst = sumfirst * sumfirst;
    
    cout << "The sum of the squares: " << squarefirst <<
            "\nThe square of the sums: " << sumfirst <<
            "\nThe difference: " << sumfirst - squarefirst << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
