/*
Problem #9 from ProjectEuler.net

A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, a < b < c, for which,

a2 + b2 = c2
For example, 32 + 42 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 52.

There exists exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which a + b + c = 1000.
Find the product abc.

The solution below allowed me to claim the 217,817th correct answer. Yay!

                every a, we pick the two options for b and c that are closest together.
