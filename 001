/*
Problem #1 from ProjectEuler.net

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5,
we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

The solution below allowed me to claim the 527,363rd correct answer. Yay!

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
    /* The easy way... Simply adds up all terms from 1 to 1000
    that are divisible by either 3 or 5. Processor intensive. */
    
    int total = 0;
    int i = 1;

    while(i < 1000){
       if(i % 3 == 0 || i % 5 == 0) total += i;   // If the number is divisible, it is added to the total.
       i++;
    }
    
    cout << "The total is: " << total << endl; 
    
    return 0;
}
